#### Info


This repository contains Python scripts for processing CSV files and performing various operations on them. Below is an overview of each script and its purpose.

### Dependencies

1. os module
2. shutil module
3. csv module
4. mysql.connector module: `pip install mysql-connector-python`
5. os module
6. re module


### File: `csv_process.py`

This script is the main entry point for the CSV processing workflow. It performs the following tasks:

1. Sorts CSV files in a specified folder based on a naming convention.
2. Moves the sorted files to corresponding destination folders.
3. Configures database connection details.
4. Defines a list of tables to process.
5. Increments CSV IDs and inserts the updated data into the respective tables.
6. Moves processed CSV files to a separate folder.

### File: `csv_to_sql.py`

This script provides a function for incrementing CSV IDs and inserting the updated data into a MySQL database table. The function `increment_csv_ids` accepts the following parameters:

- `table_name` (string): The name of the table where the data will be inserted.
- `csv_file_path` (string): The path to the CSV file containing the data.
- `db_config` (dict): The database connection configuration, including user, password, host, database, and port.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided configuration.
2. Retrieves the maximum value of the `id` column from the specified table.
3. Reads the CSV file, increments the `id` values, and stores the updated rows.
4. Inserts the updated data into the table using prepared statements.
5. Commits the changes to the database.
6. Closes the database connection.

### File: `sort_analysis_csv.py`

This script contains helper functions for sorting and organizing CSV files. The two main functions are:

- `sort_files_by_naming_convention(folder_path)`: Sorts CSV files in a specified folder based on a predefined naming convention. The function categorizes the files into different subfolders based on their naming suffixes.
- `sort_sample_from_analysis(folder)`: Separates sample and analysis CSV files within a folder and moves them to respective subfolders.

Please refer to the individual script files for more detailed function documentation and usage examples.

Feel free to customize the README file further by adding additional sections, including installation instructions, usage examples, or any other relevant information.

Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!

## File:  `execute_csv_process.php`

This script runs the main function of csv_process.py from php allowing server use.  The server must have python 3 and the proper dependencies of the existing files.
